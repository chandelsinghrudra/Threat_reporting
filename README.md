This project allows users to report threats such as scams, frauds, misinformation, phishing, and cyberattack attempts. Users can submit details through a simple web form, and all reports are stored in a MySQL database. The admin and their team can then review these reports and take suitable actions against the reported issues.

The project demonstrates how to use RDBMS concepts like table relationships, normalization, and data storage in a practical way. It’s built using Node.js and Express for the backend, EJS for the frontend, and MySQL for data management.

This system can help record real-world cases such as fake loan apps, phishing websites, scam calls, or misinformation campaigns like “Operation Sindoor.” It’s a simple and effective project that connects cybersecurity awareness with database management.
